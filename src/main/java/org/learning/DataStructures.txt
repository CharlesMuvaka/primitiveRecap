                            Data Structures.
- They represent a way to store and organise data.
- There are two types.
        1. Linear Data structures - Data is organised sequentially.
        2. Non-linear data structures

        Non-Linear data structures
- Data is not organised sequentially.
- Nodes and edges are used to represent the data and the relationship between the data respectively.
- There are two types
            1. Trees
            2. Graphs

            Graphs
- A collection of nodes and edges.
- There are many types of graphs.
        1. Directed graphs - Contains arrows showing direction from one node to the other
        2. Undirected graphs - No direction between nodes
        3. Connected and disconnected graphs - There is a relationship between one node and another in a connected graph
                                while there isn't in a disconnected graph.

- An adjacency matrix and an adjacency list are used to represent data in a graph.

            Adjacency Matrix
- Uses a multidimensional array to represent the data.
